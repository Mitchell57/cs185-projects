            <td>A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. </td>

            <td>A pitch detection algorithm (PDA) is an algorithm designed to estimate the pitch or fundamental frequency of a quasiperiodic or oscillating signal, usually a digital recording of speech or a musical note or tone. This can be done in the time domain, the frequency domain, or both.</td>

            <td>In mathematics and signal processing, the constant-Q transform, simply known as CQT transforms a data series to the frequency domain. It is related to the Fourier transform[ and very closely related to the complex Morlet wavelet transform.</td>
